📦 About This App



This is a simple tool I created for myself to randomly pick sleeves without repeating until all of them have been used.



I don’t know anything about coding - I actually used ChatGPT to help build it! So if you run into bugs or issues, I might not be able to fix them… but it works perfectly for me.

📝 How It Works



\- The app saves your sleeves to a local file: `sleeves.json`.

\- It also tracks which sleeves have already been picked using `used_sleeves.json`.

\- No internet or online storage is used — everything stays on your own device.

📁 Important Notes



\- Keep the `.exe` and both `.json` files in the same folder\*\* so the app can work properly.

\- If you move or delete the `.json` files, the app will reset with an empty sleeve list.

\- These files will be \*\*created automatically\*\* the first time you run the app.

▶️ How to Use



1\. Click \*\*"Add Sleeve"\*\* to add your own sleeve names.

⚠️ Safety Note



I understand that downloading `.exe` files can make people nervous.  

You're welcome to:



\- Read the \*\*source code\*\* (included here as `sleeved.py`)

\- Run the Python version yourself if you're more comfortable with that



No data is collected or transmitted — it runs entirely offline.
